		IMPORTANT: 
			ALL customers using any cloud functionality (Cloud API, Phone App, Remote Web Browsing) 
			MUST UPGRADE to this version until planned cloud infrastructure upgrade, otherwise they will lose cloud connectivity.		
		Planned cloud backend upgrade: 1st July 2024.
		No functionality will be lost after the upgrade.
		Cloud infrastructure upgrade will be performed by our provider Microsoft Azure (IoT Hub's Gateway v1 upgrade to v2) and 
		Device Streams (Remote Web Browsing using this technology) will be disabled.
		Our application level cloud backend services are already updated in order to comply with upcoming change (TechPoint Cloud Web Gateway v3).
		Added support for Azure Web Pub Sub as alternative to IoT Hub Device Streams. 		
		Showing device cloud information on cloud settings page on Info tab (the information that was visible on License page + more).
		Customers that were using strict firewall rules will need to allow access to new streaming endpoint: https://tpcloud.webpubsub.azure.com
		(details of what remote hosts/ports need to be allowed can be found on newly added Cloud settings Info tab).

		Showing more information regarding device stream status on cloud settings page.
		Logging events when device stream support change is detected on cloud back-end.
		Depending on the information we get regarding device stream support from our Cloud/IoT hub provider (Microsoft Azure), we might implement alternative solution.

		(device stream callback install would break cloud connection if device streams feature is not supported on the backend).
		Increased reconnect delay interval (from 1 to 30 seconds) in case of connection error.
		Showing device stream status on cloud settings page.
		Due to information from our Cloud/IoT hub provider (Microsoft Azure) that device streams feature might no longer be supported,
		this update will make sure that customers that are using only Phone app and/or Cloud API are not affected. 
		Customers that also use Remote Web Browsing feature will at least have option to disable it in order to get Phone/API features working.
		This is initial update and will most likely be followed by another update that will automatically disable device streams when lack of support is detected.
